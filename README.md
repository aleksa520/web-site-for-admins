# web-site-for-admins

Web site for admins in Angular

You can clone or download this project.

Use

```
npm install
npm install ngx-toastr --save
ng add @angular/material
npm i ng2-search-filter --save
npm start command or ng serve --o

```
It will open in browser.

We use a fake backend, that works by storing admins in a list in local storage.

We use jwt tokens and auth guards.

For products and orders, we created a mock class.
